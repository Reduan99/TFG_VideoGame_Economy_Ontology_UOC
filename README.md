# TFG_VideoGame_Economy_Ontology_UOC
Github repository for creation of an ontology process work

A semantic ontology for modelling virtual currencies, digital items and microtransaction ecosystems in videogames.

Overview

This repository contains the ontology dev as part of a Final Degree Project for the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC). The objective of this project is to conceptualize, formalize and implement an ontology describing virtual economies, microtransactions, virtual currencies and monetization mechanics in modern videogames.

Also, represent real versus virtual economic value equivalences. Classify different monetization mechanics. Show user behaviour patterns related to spendings. Enable interoperability with existing vocabularies.
